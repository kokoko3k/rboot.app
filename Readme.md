# ((â€¢)) Jdsp4Rp5 (temp root) app 
### *JamesDSP in temporary root mode for Retroid Pocket 5*

**Retroid Mini** is not officially supported, please see [here](https://github.com/kokoko3k/rboot.app/issues/4)

<br>

### The problem:
Retroid Pocket 5 speakers sounds really bad out of the box.
Unfortunately, rootless equalizer solutions cannot be applied to low latency
applications like most of the emulators, so a root solution is needed,
but rooting the Retroid Pocket 5 voids its warranty, so we'll use temporary root permissions just for the task, and a reboot will restore your console state.

### Benefit/what to expect:
* A dramatic improvement in sound quality from the speakers.
* A fairly linear frequency response from 400hz to 10khz.
obtained through profiling the sound via professional calibration 
microphone while the hands were "on" the console, That's the intended use.

### What NOT to expect:
* You won't hear anything lower than 400hz, nor did I bothered to
make it possible, since that would have lowered the volume
to absymal levels. RP5's little speakers are just not up to the task.

### Drawbacks:
* The audio output latency will increase by about 70ms.
* The output volume will be lower.
* CPU usage will be slightly higher (<1%).
